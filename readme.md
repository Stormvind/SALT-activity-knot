This is a project made during my time training at SALT.
Here is a video presentation about it: https://youtu.be/L4tNK7GMgdM

Here is a link to a deployed version: https://activity-knot.herokuapp.com/

This repository is a clone of the one that my group and I worked on. I cloned it
when the time was up. This is why there are no branches and no commitment history here.
