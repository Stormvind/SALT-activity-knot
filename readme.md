This is a project made during my time training at SALT.
Here is a video presentation about it: https://youtu.be/L4tNK7GMgdM

Here is a link to a deployed instance: https://activity-knot.herokuapp.com/

This repository is a clone of the one that my group and I worked on. I cloned it
when the time was up. This is why there are no branches and no commitment history here.

When deployed, the frontend code is bundled and served, but when we developed, we had a server that served the frontend code, and a server that had our endpoints, which the former talked to. The frontend code can be found here: https://github.com/Stormvind/SALT-activity-knot-frontend
